# Part I: Introduction

## Generalised additive models

* **G**enrealised **A**dditive **M**odel**s** (GAMs)

* $y = f(x)$
    * $f(x)$ = some function of $x$ (or *smooth function*)

## Smooth terms

* LMs have only **parametric terms**

    * `f0 ~ vowel + voicing + duration`
    
    * Parametric terms fit linear effects.

* GAMs add (non-parametric) **smooth terms** (or simply smooths, also smoothers):

    * `f0 ~ vowel + voicing + s(duration)`
    
    * `f(x)`: *some function of $x$*.
    
    * Smooth terms fit non-linear effects.

```r
library(mgcv)
gam(y ~ s(x), data)
```

The model: $y$ as *some* function of $x$





## Pupil size

* **Pupillometry data** from English young and older adults (McLaughlin et al 2022, <https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-021-01991-0>).

* **Word recognition task** (verbal stimulus + verbal response).

* Words with **sparse and dense neighbourhood** density.

* **Hypotheses**:

  * Recognizing words with more competitors (dense neighbourhood) should come at a greater cognitive cost (greater pupil size) relative to recognizing words with fewer competitors (sparse neighbourhood).
  
  * The cognitive demands associated with increased neighbourhood density (greater pupil size) should be greater for older adults compared with young adults.

* The original study used Growth Curve Analysis (GCA).

* We will apply GAMs instead.

* CAVEAT: We are analysing the whole time course, rather than just a subset as done in the original study.



```{r pdq}
pdq_20 <- readRDS("data/pdq_20.rds") %>%
  mutate(
    Condition = factor(Condition, levels = c("Sparse", "Dense")),
    Age = factor(Age, levels = c("YA", "OA")),
    pupil_z = (pupil.binned - mean(pupil.binned)) / sd(pupil.binned)
  )

pdq_20
```



```{r pdq-traj}
ggplot(pdq_20, aes(timebins, pupil_z)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.01) + facet_grid(Condition ~ Age)
```






## A simple GAM



```{r pdq-gam, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam <- bam(
  # Outcome
  pupil_z ~
    # Smooth over timebins
    s(timebins),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-sum}
summary(pdq_gam)
```



```{r pdq-gam-pred}
predict_gam(pdq_gam)
```



```{r pdq-gam-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam) %>% plot(series = "timebins")
```



```{r pdq-gam-plot-2}
predict_gam(pdq_gam, length_out = 100) %>% plot(series = "timebins")
```






## Number of knots `k`

* The "wiggliness" of the resulting spline is partially constrained by the number of *knots* (`k`).

* The more knots, the more wiggly the spline can be. Or the more knots the less smooth the spline can be.

* You can set the number of knots `k` with the argument `k` in `s()`.

```{r pdq-gam-2, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam_2 <- bam(
  pupil_z ~
    s(timebins, k = 3),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-2-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_2, length_out = 25) %>% plot(series = "timebins")
```



```{r pdq-gam-2-2, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam_2 <- bam(
  pupil_z ~
    s(timebins, k = 20),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-2-2-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_2, length_out = 100) %>% plot(series = "timebins")
```


## Comparing groups

* Comparing levels from a variable can be achieved with the **`by`-variable method**,

    * i.e. by specifying the variable as the value of the `by` argument in `s()`.

To use `by`-variables you need to:

* Change factor to an **ordered factor**.

* Change factor contrast to **treatment contrast** (`contr.treatment`).
    * The default in ordered factors is `contr.poly`, this won't work.
    
* Include the factor as a **parametric term**.

* Include a **reference smooth** and a **difference smooth** with the `by`-variable.

```{r pbq-ord}
pdq_20 <- pdq_20 %>%
  mutate(
    # Make the variables into an ordered factor
    Condition_o = as.ordered(Condition),
    Age_o = as.ordered(Age)
  )

# Change the contrasts to treatment
contrasts(pdq_20$Condition_o) <- "contr.treatment"
contrasts(pdq_20$Age_o) <- "contr.treatment"
```

Let's start with `Age_o`.

```{r pdq-gam-3, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam_3 <- bam(
  pupil_z ~
    # Parametric term
    Age_o +
    # Reference smooth (Age_0 == "YA")
    s(timebins, k = 20) +
    # Difference smooth
    s(timebins, by = Age_o, k = 20),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-3-sum}
summary(pdq_gam_3)
```



```{r pdq-gam-3-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_3, length_out = 100) %>% plot(series = "timebins", comparison = "Age_o")
```



```{r pdq-gam-3-diff}
pdq_gam_3_diff <- get_difference(
  pdq_gam_3, series = "timebins", length_out = 100,
  compare = list(Age_o = c("OA", "YA"))
)
pdq_gam_3_diff
```



```{r pdq-gam-3-diff-plot}
pdq_gam_3_diff %>% plot()
```


## Random effects



* Only **fixed effects** so far...

  * Parametric terms.
  * Smooth terms.



* **G**eneralised **A**dditive **M**ixed **M**odels (GAMMs).

* Two ways of including random effects:

  * Use the `"re"` basis function (`bs` argument in `s()`) for random intercept and slopes.

  * Include a **random smooth** term with the **factor smooth interaction** as basis (`bs = "fs"`).
  


* The **factor smooth interaction** method is more robust.



* **Factor smooth interaction**:
    * `bs = "fs"`.
    * A smooth is fitted at each level of a factor.
    * NOTE: it has *interaction* in the name but has nothing to do with interactions

* The random effect variable *needs to be a factor*.



Let's change `subject` to a factor (no need to make it an ordered factor).

```{r pdq-fac}
pdq_20 <- pdq_20 %>%
  mutate(
    subject = as.factor(subject)
  )
pdq_20
```




```{r pdq-gam-4, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam_4 <- bam(
  pupil_z ~
    # Paramteric term
    Age_o +
    # Reference smooth
    s(timebins, k = 20) +
    # Difference smooth
    s(timebins, by = Age_o, k = 20) +
    # Factor smooth interaction by subject
    s(timebins, subject, bs = "fs", m = 1),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-4-sum}
summary(pdq_gam_4)
```



```{r pdq-gam-4-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_4, length_out = 100, exclude_terms = "s(timebins,subject)") %>%
  plot(series = "timebins", comparison = "Age_o")
```



```{r pdq-gam-4-plot-2}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_4, length_out = 100, values = c(Age_o = "YA")) %>% # filter only YA subjects
  filter(subject %in% c(1:10)) %>% plot(series = "timebins")
```

## Comparing across groups (interactions)



* Technically, GAMs **don't allow interactions**.

  * They are ADDITIVE (interactions require multiplication).



* We can get interaction-like comparisons by creating **factor interactions** and using them as `by`-variables.



Let's create a factor interaction between `Age_o` and `Condition_o`.

We also need to make it into an ordered factor with treatment contrasts.

```{r pdq-int}
pdq_20 <- pdq_20 %>%
  mutate(
    Age_Cond = as.ordered(interaction(Age_o, Condition_o))
  )

contrasts(pdq_20$Age_Cond) <- "contr.treatment"
```



```{r pdq-gam-5, cache=TRUE}
pdq_gam_5 <- bam(
  pupil_z ~
    # Paramteric term
    Age_Cond +
    # Reference smooth
    s(timebins, k = 20) +
    # Difference smooth
    s(timebins, by = Age_Cond, k = 20) +
    # Factor smooth interaction by subject
    s(timebins, subject, bs = "fs", m = 1),
  data = pdq_20
)
```



```{r pdq-gam-5-sum}
summary(pdq_gam_5)
```




```{r pdq-gam-5-plot}
predict_gam(pdq_gam_5, length_out = 100, exclude_terms = "s(timebins,subject)") %>%
  plot(series = "timebins", comparison = "Age_Cond")
```



```{r pdq-gam-5-plot-2}
pdq_gam_5_pred_2 <- predict_gam(
  pdq_gam_5, length_out = 100, exclude_terms = "s(timebins,subject)",
  separate = list(Age_Cond = c("Age", "Condition"))
) %>%
  # The separate arguments returns variables with default alphabetical order.
  # Let's reorder the levels in Condition and Age.
  mutate(
    Condition = factor(Condition, levels = c("Sparse", "Dense")),
    Age = factor(Age, levels = c("YA", "OA")),
  )
```



```{r pdq-gam-5-pred-2-plot}
pdq_gam_5_pred_2 %>% plot(series = "timebins", comparison = "Condition") + facet_grid(~ Age)
```




```{r pdq-gam-5-diff}
pdq_gam_5_diff <- get_difference(
  pdq_gam_5, series = "timebins", length_out = 100, exclude_terms = "s(timebins,subject)",
  compare = list(Age_Cond = c("YA.Dense", "YA.Sparse"))
)
```


```{r pdq-gam-5-diff-plot}
pdq_gam_5_diff %>% plot()
```
